        </p>
        <p>
          Please read these Terms carefully. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE PLATFORM,
          YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY

        <h3>1. Our Platform Services</h3>
        <p>
          Wizard Parking provides a technology platform that connects users
          seeking parking with independent owners and operators of parking
          facilities ("Operators"). Our services ("Platform Services") are
          limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Informing users of the location and potential availability of
            parking spots ("Parking Spots").
          </li>
          <li>Facilitating reservations ("Reservations") for Parking Spots.</li>
          <li>
            Processing payments on behalf of the Operators for these
            Reservations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you pay for a Reservation through our Platform, your payment
          obligation to the Operator for that Reservation is fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Wizard Parking is NOT a parking company.</strong> We do not
          own, operate, or manage any parking lots or facilities. We do not
          accept custody of vehicles. Our role is strictly to provide the
          software that connects you with the parking Operator. The actual
          parking service is provided by the Operator, not by Wizard Parking. We
          are not responsible for the safety of persons or property at any
          parking facility.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Third-Party Operators</h3>
        <p>
          The Parking Spots are owned and managed by independent, third-party
          Operators. When you make a Reservation, you enter into an agreement
          directly with the Operator. Your use of the Parking Spot is subject to
          the Operator's own rules, terms, and conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          By making a Reservation, you agree to comply with the specific
          policies of the parking facility. Wizard Parking is not responsible
          for any disputes or issues that may arise between you and an Operator.
        </p>

        <h3>3. User Accounts and Guest Checkout</h3>
        <p>
          You may use the Platform to make reservations as a guest or by
          creating a user account ("Account") for an enhanced experience, such
          as saving your vehicle and payment information.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that any information you provide, whether for a guest
          transaction or for your Account, will be accurate, current, and
          complete. If you choose to create an Account, you are solely
          responsible for all activity that occurs under it and for keeping your
          password secure. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized
          use of your Account.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Your privacy is important to us. Our collection and use of your
          personal information are described in our
          <strong><a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></strong
          >. By using the Platform, you consent to our collection and use of
          personal data as outlined therein.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Fees and Payments</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for all charges and taxes associated with your
          Reservations. You agree that Wizard Parking may charge your selected
          payment method (credit card, debit card, etc.) for the total amount
          displayed at checkout.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Wizard Parking partners with a third-party payment processor to
            handle all payment transactions.
          </strong>
          By making a Reservation, you agree to the terms and conditions of our
          payment processor. When you provide a payment method to us, we will
          ensure that data is handled in a secure, PCI-compliant manner.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Cancellations and Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          Reservations made through the Platform are subject to the cancellation
          policy that is displayed at the time of booking. Please review the
          cancellation details for each specific Reservation before you confirm.
          Unless otherwise stated in the booking details, reservations are
          non-refundable after the reservation start time has passed.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>
          The Platform and its entire contents, features, and functionality
          (including all software, text, images, and branding) are the exclusive
          property of Wizard Parking LLC and are protected by copyright and
          other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, reproduce, modify,
          or distribute any of the content without our express written
          permission.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Prohibited Activities</h3>
        <p>
          You agree not to use the Platform to engage in any fraudulent or
          illegal activities. You may not use automated systems (like bots or
          scrapers) to access the Platform for any purpose without our express
          written permission. Reselling reservations is strictly prohibited.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY
          OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WIZARD PARKING DOES NOT
          WARRANT THAT THE PLATFORM WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF
          ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WIZARD
          PARKING LLC, ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OFFICERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
          INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
          OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM OR ANY PARKING SERVICES. OUR
          TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE
          PLATFORM IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO WIZARD PARKING IN
          THE LAST 12 MONTHS, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS
          GREATER.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Indemnity</h3>
        <p>
          You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Wizard Parking LLC
          and its employees from and against any claims, liabilities, damages,
          losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising
          out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the
          Platform or your violation of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>12. Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>
          We may modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any
          material changes by posting the new Terms on the Platform. By
          continuing to use the Platform after the changes become effective, you
          agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>13. Dispute Resolution and Mandatory Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Platform
          will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except
          that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims
          qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply
          to this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
            arbitration award is limited.
          </strong>
          However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same
          damages and relief as a court.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting
          arbitration and describing your claim to our legal department at the
          contact email below. The arbitration will be conducted by the American
          Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE
            CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS,
            CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
          </strong>
        </p>
